They will appear occasionally when trees such as $(l:herbology/herbology#rowan)Rowan$(/l), $(l:herbology/herbology#hawthorn)Hawthorn$(/l) and $(l:herbology/herbology#alder)Alder$(/l) are felled in large quantities.$(p)Ents are rather hard to kill by normal means, but they do have a healthy hatred of certain tools for some reason or another."
